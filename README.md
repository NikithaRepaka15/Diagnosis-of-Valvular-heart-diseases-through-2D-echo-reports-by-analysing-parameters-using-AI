This research project is dedicated to revolutionizing the diagnosis of valvular heart diseases by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), specifically a fuzzy logic system integrated with weights, for the analysis of 2D echocardiography reports. The objective is to employ sophisticated AI algorithms capable of comprehensively interpreting diverse parameters extracted from echocardiograms.

Through the fusion of fuzzy logic methodologies with medical imaging data, the study seeks to establish an automated and accurate diagnostic framework for valvular heart diseases. This involves the extraction of nuanced information from 2D echo reports, enabling the AI system to discern patterns and indicators associated with various valvular conditions, aided by the integration of weighted parameters for enhanced precision.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to contribute a novel and impactful solution to the field of cardiology through the publication of a research paper. By automating the analysis process using fuzzy logic and weighted parameters, the project aims to provide clinicians with a more efficient and reliable tool for identifying and classifying valvular heart diseases. The paper will document the implemented fuzzy logic system, detailing its methodology, results, and implications, thereby offering a tangible and reproducible contribution to the medical community. This publication represents a substantial advancement in the integration of advanced AI techniques, particularly fuzzy logic, in cardiology, holding promise for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in the realm of valvular heart diseases.
